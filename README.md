# Fleabyte

Modern BadUSB firmware for the LilyGO T-Dongle S3. Self-hosted web UI,
twelve keyboard layouts, fully offline.

Plug it in, then unlock it with three short button presses followed by two
long presses (`SSSLL`; long means at least 200 ms by default). Until unlocked,
the dongle stays dark with Wi-Fi off and exposes only mass storage. Startup standby
can be disabled in settings; armed boot runs still stay locked and dark. Scan the code on
its screen to join, open the page, pick the keyboard layout of the machine
it is plugged into, and run a script. Nothing leaves the device and nothing
needs installing.

## What it does

* Keystroke scripting with a DuckyScript subset, from a web editor
* Twelve keyboard layouts, switchable at runtime and mid-script
* Payload library stored on the dongle, editable from the browser
* Wi-Fi join code on the screen, so a phone connects without typing a key
* Cancellable countdown before a payload starts
* Host detection, so a payload can wait for the machine instead of guessing
* microSD exposed to the host as a removable drive, with a file browser
* One-shot arming that fires the script you are editing at the next plug-in
* Status screen with run progress, and a light that reports what it is doing

## Scope of use

Machines you own, or for which you hold written authorisation. This is a
keystroke injection tool: it types into whatever it is plugged into.

Execution is triggered from the web interface, or by arming a single run for
the next plug-in from the bar under the editor. That arming is one shot and
clears itself as it fires. An armed run enables the keyboard while the screen
and Wi-Fi stay off; a pending hard lock blocks it. Nothing else runs on plug-in, and the
button on the dongle never starts a payload.

## Hardware

A LilyGO T-Dongle S3 and nothing else. A microSD card is optional, and only
used by the USB drive feature.

* [LilyGO store](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-dongle-s3)
* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0BK9162QY)
* [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/pla/LILYGO-T-Dongle-S3-ESP32-S3-Development-Board-096_1601590830049.html)

It has to be the **S3**. LilyGO also sells a T-Dongle C5, and the ESP32-C5
has no USB OTG controller: it can only present a serial port, never a
keyboard. The same goes for the C3, C6 and H2. Among the parts LilyGO uses,
only the S2, S3 and P4 can do this at all.

## Installing

**[Flash it from your browser](https://b3rt1ng.github.io/FleaByte/)**, in
Chrome or Edge on a desktop. Nothing to install: hold the button while
plugging the dongle in, click Install, pick the serial port.

Or take the image from a [release](../../releases) and write it yourself:

```sh
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 write-flash 0x0 firmware.bin
```

Either way the image stops before the filesystem partition, so an update
keeps saved payloads and settings.

  settings and the USB drive
* [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) collects the hardware quirks worth knowing before
  changing anything
